## Research Artifacts


This is the supplementary material for the SLR on “Junior Software Engineers’ Perspectives on adopting Large Language Models for Development”. This SLR employed the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham et al. We performed a search across 7 digital libraries(ACM DL, IEEE xplore, SpringerLink, Wiley, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Arxiv). This repository contains:


* SLR Protocol 
* SLR Data Extraction Form 
* SLR Data


### SLR Protocol


The `SLR_Protocol.pdf` file presents the research methodology applied during the study. It includes:
* Object
* Background
* PICOC
* Research questions
* Base search string
* Search string for each 7 databases


### SLR Data Extraction Form


The `SLR_DataExtractionForm.pdf` file presents the Google forms used for data extraction, containing 36 questions. 




### SLR Data 


The `SLR_Data.xlsx` file contains all data separated in the following sheets:

* **Included Paper List** sheet: List of all papers and relatedbasic info. 


* **Form Responses** sheet: All the data extracted from primary study using google forms. 


* **Publication Trends** sheet -- analysis of publication trends (e.g., publication venues, domains) in the selected studies. 


* **(RQ1) Motivations and Methodological Approaches** sheet -- has the analysis of data relevant to RQ1 (e.g., study motivations, research methods ) for all the included studies. 


* **(RQ2) Key Software Development Tasks** sheet -- has the analysis of data related to RQ2 (e.g., LLM tools) for all the included studies. 


* **(RQ3) Perceptions about LLM4SE** sheet -- has analysis of data relevant to RQ3 (e.g., perceived benefits, challenges) for all the included studies.


* **(RQ4) Limitations and Future Research Needs** sheet -- has the analysis of data related to RQ4 (e.g., study limitations)  for all the included studies.
