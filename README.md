## SLR Research Artifacts


This is the supplementary material for the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on **Novice Software Engineers’ Perspectives on Adopting Large Language Models for Development**. 

This SLR employed the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham et al in `Kitchenham, B., & Charters, S. (2007). Guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in software engineering`.

We performed a search across seven digital libraries (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, Wiley, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and arXiv).
